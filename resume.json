years this gateway is still Upstream's main integration solution; it has processed hundreds of millions of
transactions and a team of three people is working on extensions and improvements of a product, which
solid foundations have been set by Ioannis few years ago. This achievement alone states the obvious, that
Ioannis is a highly skilled professional, extremely productive and committed to his work."
